## Course Description
This course is a hands-on introduction to analyzing, designing, coding, and testing computer programs. Students will develop algorithms for problem solving with an emphasis on good programming practices. Students will use programming techniques including control structures, files management, arrays, and subprograms to design and code basic programs using a modern computer language. Other topics include working with data, number systems, and an introduction to object-oriented and event-driven programming. This course prepares students for software development courses in programming and web development. Students with a demonstrated background in computer programming (transcript, job experience, or waiver exam) may request to have this course waived as a pre-requisite to subsequent courses through the department office.

After completing this course, you will be able to:

1. Explain number systems and the internal representation of data.
	- Know how computers represent data internally
	- Define basic storage units such as byte, Kbyte, Mbyte.
	- Convert numbers from binary to decimal and from decimal to binary
1. Solve problems with simple sequence, selection, and repetition statements by using different data type variables, expressions, and flow of control.
	- Define variables and constants, select the correct data type for a variable, and describe the relationship between variables and memory.
	- Build expressions involving the assignment and the basic mathematical operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
	- Evaluate logical expressions involving relational and logical operators
	- Know when to use a selection and/or a repetition statement
	- Solve problems using `if`, nested `if` statements and the `case` structure
	- Solve problems using counter-controlled, sentinel and nested loops.
1. Create and use arrays of data.
	- List the benefits of using arrays
	- Describe how arrays are represented in memory
	- Solve problems using arrays
1. Create and call modules.
	- List the benefits of decomposing large problems into modules
	- Know how to create a module and call the module
	- Solve problems using modules


## Course Materials

Our course will utilize totally free materials available via an open source license and available through your Blackboard course. However, you will need to make sure you have reliable access to:
- A computer with administrator-level access for at least 8 hours a week
- Reliable internet connection for at least 8 hours a week

## Evaluation

Please see the attached schedule for deadlines.

Component 										| Weight
---														| ---
Reading, Quizzes, Assignments	| 35%
Mini Projects									| 30%
Full Projects									| 15%
Final Project									| 20%
**Total**											| **100%**

-	**Reading, Quizzes, Assignments** – this includes weekly reading, assignments, and quizzes completed during lessons.
-	**Mini Projects** – a set of programming projects that will help you strengthen your skills as a developer.
-	**Full Projects** – similar to mini projects, but with wider scope. Full projects take a little longer to complete, and require you to connect ideas discussed across readings.
-	**Final Project** – assigned about 2 weeks before the end of the term. The final project is not required, but without the final project it is mathematically impossible to earn more than 80%.

### Grade Scale

Score		| Grade
---			| ---
90-100%	| A
80-89%	| B
70-79%	| C
60-69%	| D
60% and :arrow_down: | F

Students must complete all coursework or they will be assigned a grade of 0 for any work not submitted, unless it is an optional assignment.

### Missed tests, Late Assignments, and Make-up Policy

Any assignments accepted late are subject to a minimum 10% point deduction, at the professor’s discretion. Check with the professor if you miss an assignment to see if it can be made up. If you know you will be absent, you may request assignments early from the professor and completing the assignment early will not incur a penalty.

## Important Dates

Classes begin August 29. Drop/ Refund/ No Show Deadline 11:59 p.m. September 6.  Withdrawal deadline for W grade is 11:59 p.m. November 11.  Classes end December 11. Final Exams December 12-18.  For final exam date and time --see final exam schedule at http://valenciacollege.edu/calendar/FinalExam.cfm

## Academic Honesty

You are allowed to work together on reading assignments. You may consult classmates and the internet on projects (including the final project), but all work turned in must be your own; DO NOT to share code with others, and DO NOT copy code from the internet. You are NOT allowed to work together on quizzes or the midterm. The software used in this course has advanced plagiarism detection mechanisms. If you are caught using information from, or giving information to others, you will (at a minimum) receive:
- A zero on that assignment, and
- A grade reduction in the course grade.

## Class Attendance and Withdrawal policy

For the purposes of an online class, attendance is counted by the submission of a quiz, assignment, or project. Simply signing into the course does not mean you are “present”. During the first week of class, you are required to submit the Course Orientation in the “Start Here” module. Failure to complete this assignment by 11:59pm on September 6 will result in your withdrawal of the course as a no-show.

If you miss a class, you are still responsible for covered material and assignments collected or assigned. Although I have the authority to withdraw any student who misses more than 2 weeks of classes, I do not as a practice withdraw students for non-attendance. Students may withdraw at any time up to the withdrawal deadline and receive a grade of “W”. If the student is withdrawn after the withdrawal deadline has passed, the final grade will reflect what the student has earned in the course thus far along with zeros for any assignments still left for the student to complete.

Before choosing to withdraw, you should speak first with me regarding your progress in the course and with an Academic Advisor to discuss the impact of the W on your academic progress, future fees, and financial aid.
